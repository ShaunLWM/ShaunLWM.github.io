title: 7 Continents
---

There are 7 continents in the world. Or at least what most of us were taught.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-24-Number-of-Continents-1.png)

They are (in descending size):

- Asia
- Africa
- North America
- South America
- Antarctica
- Europe
- Oceania/Australia

But the fact is that no one knows what a continent is and isn't. The definition of Continents is:

> Large landmasses separated from others by ocean

For example: Europe and Asia are not separated by any ocean, thus is sometimes called Eurasia. Moreover, they are called a continent each on their own, due to their huge cultural differences. And consequently, contradicting the definition.

At the end of the day, we will never stop drawing a line on what defines a continent. This resulted in a different count of continents, taught by different teachers all over the world.

But fret not, the 7 listed above is good enough for your day-to-day interactions.

## Fun fact:

Australia is both a country and a continent. But they should not be confused together. The continent that it lies on it's called Oceania or Australasia, together with New Zealand and other countries.
