title: Human's Nail - The Half Moon
---

The half-moon shape at the base of the fingernail is called the 'Lunula' in medical terms. This is the fancy Latin way of saying 'Moon-like' and it is the visible part of the root of our nail.

This moon-like structure is responsible for the growth of the entire fingernail - where destroying a part of it could dampen the growth of the nail. It is part of the nail matrix - which is the tissue just beneath the nail. It contains nerves, lymph, and blood vessels, and also produces the cells that become the hardened nail plate, which is what we see. If we were to damage the Lunula or part of the nail, we can see something called Beau's Lines (indentations that run across the nails). By looking at the distance of these lines from the nail matrix, we can tell approximately how long ago the injury happened.

Though some of us can only see a part or none of the Lunula, it's nothing to be worried about. In these cases, it is most likely hidden under the skin (provided you are healthy and not suffering from any conditions - malnutrition, anemia, etc.)
