In their first year of training, these graduates are called intern where they will be attached to senior physicians or doctors.
These trainings can last from 2 to 7 years depending on the type of specializations they are pursuing. Subsequently, any further trainings for certain specialties, or subspecialties within specialities are called _fellowship_.
