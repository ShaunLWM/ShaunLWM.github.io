title: Drowning is not what it seems.
---

Drowning is not what it seems like in the movies. You don't get to see someone screaming for help or splashing of water - if they even have the chance to flail their arms.

The **Instinctive Drowning Response** is an instinctive reaction that occurs in humans [1], and it is something that humans do to avoid suffocation in water.

The reason being - speech is a secondary function when we are gasping for air. **Breathing has to take place first**, in order for speech to occur. The mouth of the drowning person does not stay above water long enough to exhale + inhale + call for help. Furthermore, our arms to designed to be raise laterally for pressing down on the surface of the water. Raising our arms will cause us to go down under again, in which the body is already trying hard to fight against. Consequently, the whole struggle last from 20 to 60 seconds before submersion occurs.

## Signs of drowning

- Mouth at water level
- Head tilted back
- Eyes closed
- Hyperventilating or gasping

If someone can't answer to "Are you alright?", you have less than 30 seconds to get to them.
