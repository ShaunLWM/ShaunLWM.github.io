title: Large Animals and Cancer
---

Wild animals do get cancer too, though of a lower percentage. In Canada's St Lawrence estuary, intestinal cancer is the second most common cause of death for beluga whales: 27% of them are affected. However, there are exceptions. A few animals don't seem to get cancer very often, or at all.

Cancer occurs when a seemingly normal cell spirals out of control. Usually, old or damaged cells are destroyed, but occasionally one will keep reproducing, creating more and more rogue cells. The eventual result is a tumor. Put in a simple number game, we should all think that - the larger the size of a living thing, the higher chance of getting cancer due to it having more cells right?

But it turns out not all cells are equally prone to cancer.

Elephants have trillions more cells than us and live a long time, yet they have lower cancer rates. The elephant genome turned out to contain a lot of copies of a known cancer-fighting gene - known as **p53**, a tumor suppressor. Most mammals have it, including humans, but we only have one copy whereas elephants have 20. The main purpose of this is to stop the cell from proliferating, giving it the time it needs to repair itself. Secondly, if the cell cannot be fixed, the gene prompts it to commit suicide, a process called apoptosis.

As opposed to the Peto's paradox of hypertumor (cancer cells killing cancer cells), a blue whale cell may take about an entire week before division, compared to human's cell division of about 24 hours. Large animals have lower metabolic rates (per unit mass) as well.

As a result, the human cell may accumulate more mutations needed for cancer to form into tumors as compared to the whale to just get one.
