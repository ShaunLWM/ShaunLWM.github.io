title: Expiry on Water Bottles
---

Will you get diarrhea or food poisoning from the bottle of expired water that you just picked up in the storeroom?

Of cos not. We all have seen before the expiry on the bottle of water purchased from supermarkets or given free in goodie bags. However, the expiry date on the bottle is not meant for the water as water doesn't go bad. The expiry date is for the plastic bottle and sooner or later, chemicals will start seeping into the water.

Furthermore, the reason for stamping the expiration dates on the bottle is that water is a consumable food product and it is by law that all consumables are to be tagged with an expiration date. This attribute also helps the company in lawsuits against people who are suing them for having a tummyache after drinking their bottled water, where the company can then refute by saying the water is past the deadline.

There are many reasons as to why the expiration dates are printed on the water. But at the end of the day, we have to know that:

1. Water doesn't expire.

2. Consumable products require an expiration date.

3. The expiration date is also for the plastic bottle.
