Layaway is a purchasing method in which a consumer places a deposit on an item to "lay it away" for later pick-up when they are financially positioned to pay off the balance. Layaway also lets customers make smaller payments on the product until the purchase is paid in full. A layaway plan ensures the consumer will get their chosen merchandise once it's fully paid.

## For example

-   Item: \$200
-   Available cash: \$120
-   Remaining: \$80
-   Paid within: Next X days

The item will then be reserved for the customer until the full payment is made.
