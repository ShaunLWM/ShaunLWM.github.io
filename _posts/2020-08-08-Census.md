How exactly does the government of a country determine the population of their country?

A Census is the procedure of acquiring and recording information about the population through polls, surveys, etc. Most countries used this method to do an estimate of the population and make important policy decisions, like setting aside a budget, anticipate taxes, etc. However, we have to know that these information isn't 100% accurate. It relays on the citizen giving them the correct information, while at the same time, making sure that everyone receives this poll in the country.

Most developed countries normally use social security numbers and their identification number, while some countries may use satellite and aerial photography. It gives an insight into changes of the settlement on a larger scale, allowing the government to derive the number of people living in each particular area.
