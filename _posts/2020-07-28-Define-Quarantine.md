title: Define Quarantine
---

The word _quarantine_ is derived from the word _quarantena_ which means "forty days", and was first used in the 14th-15th century Venetians (people staying in the Northeast of Italy).

During that period, all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the Black Death pandemic, which initially followed the 30 days isolation period that was first imposed in 1347. It was only in the 1448 that the Venetians lengthened the waiting period to 40 days, thus giving birth to the new term "quarantine".

As a result, it proved to be an effective formula for handling outbreaks of the plague, due to the fact that the plague had a 37-days period from infection to death.
