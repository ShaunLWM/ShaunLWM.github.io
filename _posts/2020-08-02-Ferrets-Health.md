title: Ferrets' Health
---

Ferrets are induced ovulators, which means that they won't ovulate until they are mated. As a result, Unspayed female ferrets will die if they do not mate in a year.

The reason being - once they reach maturity, they will always be in heat (able to have sex and become pregnant). The high levels of estrogens produced may cause bone marrow suppression [1] in extended heat. In short, the longer she doesn't mate, the more estrogen is released into the bloodstream which in excess, can suppress the bone marrow and stops making new blood cells.

## Fun Fact

The trigger for ovulation in ferrets is physical trauma to the neck (from the hob’s teeth where he bites her while mating) and the vagina (caused by the sharp barbs on his penis). In fact, the more trauma inflicted, the more eggs she releases - resulting in more offsprings.
