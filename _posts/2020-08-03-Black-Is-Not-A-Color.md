title: Black is NOT a color
---

"Black is my favorite color." or is it?

Black is not a color. It is just an absence of light. As compared to other colors where they are a reflection of light, black can exist without any light at all.

Think about it this way. Both black and white aren't colors - they are shades. They augment color in a way that they darken or lighten colors. The black that you paint on your drawing paper are pigments. Enter a room without light and everything is dark and black - the absence of light. Even colors like white and pink are not present in the spectrum of colors because they are the products of our eyes mixing wavelengths of light.
