title: Coprophagia

Coprophagia is the process where an animal eats the feces of other animals - in which case where these feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested food. And yes, they are eaten right off the anus. The main focus of this act is for the reabsorbing of tough plant materials, which allows them to be thoroughly digested by passing twice through the digestive tract.

Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the feces of their mother to obtain the necessary bacteria for the proper digestion of the vegetation found on the savannah and in the jungle. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from plants.

Gorillas eat their feces and the feces of other gorillas. Hamsters eat their droppings; this is thought to be a source of vitamins B and K, produced by bacteria in the gut. Apes have been observed eating horse feces for the salt. Monkeys have been observed to eat elephant feces. Coprophagia has also been observed in the naked mole-rat.
