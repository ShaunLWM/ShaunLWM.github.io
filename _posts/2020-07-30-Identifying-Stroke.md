title: Identifying Stroke

Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States experiences a stroke. And every 4 minutes, a life is lost due to stroke. Nearly 87% of all strokes are due to the restriction of blood flow to the brain. Identifying a stroke patient within 3 hours of the first symptoms can potentially save their life.
