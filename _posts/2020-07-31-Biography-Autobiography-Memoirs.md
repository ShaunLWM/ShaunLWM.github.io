title: Biography vs Autobiography vs Memoirs
---

These 3 primary formats are used to tell the life story of a certain person - Biography, Autobiography, and Memoirs. However, the usage of these 3 words can be a little daunting as they all share several similarities. We do see them in book stores, in movies, etc. but what exactly do these terms mean?

## Biography

TLDR: The life history of an individual, written by someone else.

A Biography (aka bio.) is a non-fiction piece of work that accounts for a person's life, written by someone else. It can include several pieces of information (most probably in chronological order), which can include their birthplace, education, relations, and many others. This information are normally retrieved via interviews, letters, diaries, photographs, essays, reference books, and newspapers.

Examples:

- Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges
- E=mc² by David Bodanis
- Mao: The Unknown Story by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday

## Autobiography

TLDR: Story of a person's life, written by the person him/herself.

An Autobiography is the story of a particular person, written by that person. As a result, these autobiographies are normally in a first-person point of view. The main focus of an autobiography is to portray the life experiences and achievements of the author, thus, normally written in the later stage of the person's life.

The content does not defer much as compared to a biography, but defers in terms of being subjective - in a sense that since they were written by the subject, the story _may be_ skewed towards their biasness.

Examples:

- The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank
- Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler
- The Story of My Experiments with Truth by Mahatma Gandhi

## Memoirs

TLDR: A collection of memories written by the person themselves.

Similarly to an autobiography, a memoir is a story of the person's life written by the person themselves. The difference is that a memoir focuses on reflection and establishing an emotional connection, rather than simply presenting the facts around their life. The author uses their personal knowledge to tell an intimate and emotional story about the private or public happenings in their life. The topic is intentionally focused and does not include biographical or chronological aspects of the author’s life unless they are meaningful and relevant to the story.

Examples:

- Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant By Ulysses Grant
- Becoming by Michelle Obama
- The Story of My Life by Helen Keller
